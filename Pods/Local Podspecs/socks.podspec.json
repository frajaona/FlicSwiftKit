  "description": "The package provides two libraries: `SocksCore` and `Socks`.\n- `SocksCore` is just a Swift wrapper of the Berkeley sockets API with minimal differences. It is meant to be an easy way to use the low level API without having to deal with Swift/C interop.\n- `Socks` is a library providing common usecases built on top of `SocksCore` - a simple `TCPClient`, `SynchronousTCPServer` etc.\n\nIf you're building a HTTP server, you'll probably want to use the `TCPClient`, without having to worry about its implementation details. However, if you need the low-level sockets API, just import `SocksCore` and use that instead.\n\n> Pure-Swift Sockets. Linux & OS X ready.",
